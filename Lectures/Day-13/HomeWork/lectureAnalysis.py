#################### Wine Data set #################################3
# 1. Download Wine dataset (wine.data) from UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine).
# Note: This website is a good resource for open data


# 2. Read the wine.data file as data frame (name the dataframe as winedata). 
# Don't be concerned that it is not a .csv file. 
# Open the document in text editor and see that it indeed has comma separated values. 
# You can read this file using regular csv reading functions. 
# Note that the file does not have header (column headings)
winedata = pd.read_csv("wine.data",header = None)
# Additional Note: You could directly read the data from the web by 
# passing url as the path argument for csv reading function

# 3. Names of 13 attributes can be found in the description. 
# It is a labelled data set with 3 classes of wines; 
# note that 1st column in the data corresponds to wine class and has to be removed. 
# Add column names to the data frame.
